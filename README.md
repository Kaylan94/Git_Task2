# Online Store #
### HTML CSS JavaScript ###

*This project was developed to showcase my ability to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each of the five areas of the online store is featured on separate pages while the design 
remains consistent throughout. The design boast features that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also add to the user experience. For ease of navigation, each of the pages 
are linked together. The 'shop' page displays a product catalogue and also includes a functional shopping cart. The functionality, developed with Javascript, extends all the way
through to the check-out page this project showcases an excellent use of forms.*

## Getting Started 

To get started create a folder on your local device in which you will store each of the html file. In the same folder create another directory called assets. Herein, create 
another three folders namely; images, css and JavaScript. Store each of the files in their respective folders. Once completed you can now click on any of the html files, which 
should open up in your browser. 


## Usage 

Recommended that you start on the home page and experience the landing page before continuing. The purpose of the landing page is to grab the attention of the page vistor/user and then hold that attention long enough for a sale or a hot lead. 

Some features added here that correlate with this:

  * Transitioning background images and colors
  * Contextual content 
  * pop up dialogs
  
### Figure 1 - Home Page ###

There are links to the other pages on the top and the bottom of the page for ease of navigation. The most important of which is the Shop. Here, you will find the product 
catalogue which is in the form of a collapsible hover table. 

### Figure 2 - Shop Page ###

Only once the user clicks on a particular short-hand description the row collapses revealing secondary table which displays the product description, image and pricing. Furthermore, there is a button at each of these drop downs - The user can click on this button to add the current product to their cart. 

### Figure 3 - Catalogue ###

Each time an item is added an alert is presented to update the user of the current cart tally. The top right-hand corner of the page is home to the cart icon and 
cart-counter. 

The cart icon is clickable and when clicked on a smaller container rolls out and displays each of the items added to cart. At this stage each item is accompanied 
by a remove button, giving the user a chance to alter their order. 

In the event that the remove button is clicked the following things happen:

  * The item is removed from the cart
  * The count is adjusted accordingly, and
  * another alert is raised to inform the user of their updated tally

Alternative if the user proceeds to click on the check-out button, which is also located in the shopping-cart container, the user is taken to a new page - the check-out page.
Here the user is presented with their cart and the total for these items alone.

Below this there is a form which is used to capture the user/customer details and also their delivery details. Any discount coupons are also added here. On submission of the form an alert is raised with the complete order details and a generated order number. finally, once this has been accepted an invoice display is rolled out.
